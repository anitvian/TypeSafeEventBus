# Type-Safe Event Bus (In Progress)

A learning project where I build a simple event-driven system in Java from scratch.

## Current Progress
âœ… Manual event publishing and listeners  
ðŸš§ Next: Introduce com.eventBus.EventBus for automatic listener management

## Goal
Build a type-safe, generic event bus similar to Springâ€™s ApplicationEventPublisher or Guava com.eventBus.EventBus.
