# Type-Safe Event Bus (In Progress)

A learning project where I build a simple event-driven system in Java from scratch.

## Current Progress
âœ… Manual event publishing and listeners  
ðŸš§ Next: Introduce EventBus for automatic listener management

## Goal
Build a type-safe, generic event bus similar to Springâ€™s ApplicationEventPublisher or Guava EventBus.
# Type-Safe Event Bus (In Progress)

A learning project where I build a simple **event-driven system** in Java from scratch.

---

## Current Progress
âœ… Manual event publishing and listeners implemented  
âœ… EventBus added for automatic listener management  
âœ… Listeners (WelcomeEmailListener, AnalyticsListener) registered with EventBus  
âœ… UserService decoupled from listeners

---

## Next Steps
ðŸš§ Refactor EventBus to be **generic and type-safe**  
ðŸš§ Support multiple event types beyond `UserRegisteredEvent`  
ðŸš§ Add more listeners to demonstrate scalability

---

## Goal
Build a **type-safe, generic event bus** similar to **Springâ€™s ApplicationEventPublisher** or **Guava EventBus**, capable of handling multiple event types and listeners dynamically.
