# Type-Safe Event Bus (In Progress)

A learning project where I build a simple **event-driven system** in Java from scratch.

---

## Current Progress

-- âœ” Manual event publishing and listeners implemented

- âœ” EventBus introduced for automatic listener management
- âœ” Listeners (`WelcomeEmailListener`, `AnalyticsListener`) registered dynamically
- âœ” `UserService` fully decoupled from listeners
- âœ” EventBus refactored to be **type-safe** and support **multiple event types**
- âœ” Added a second event (`UserDeletedEvent`) and verified **multi-event handling**
- âœ” Each event type triggers its respective listeners correctly
- âœ” Application successfully tested **end-to-end**

---

## Next Steps

ðŸš§ Add asynchronous event dispatching using `ExecutorService`  
ðŸš§ Introduce a global event logger to track all published events  
ðŸš§ Write unit tests for `EventBus` and individual listeners  
ðŸš§ Add error handling for failed or unregistered listeners

---

## Goal

Build a **type-safe, generic event bus** similar to **Springâ€™s ApplicationEventPublisher** or **Guava EventBus**,
capable of handling multiple event types and listeners dynamically.
